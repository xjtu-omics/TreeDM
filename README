Welcome to TreeDM(PGOneI)

Usage: ./TreeDM [options] ...

options:
  -n   <int>   The minimal number of non_wildcard residues in the pattern to be reported
  -s   <float>   The minimal proportion of proteins haveing the pattern
  -m   <int>   The maximal length of wildcard in the patterns
  -i   <string>   The pathway and filename of sequences in fasta format
  -p   <string>   The pathway and filename of the PatternSpace filedefaults: ./ppfile
  -o   <string>   The pathway of the distance matrix(defaults: ./)
  -h/?   help pritn this message
  
  
Use this code to generate a distance matrix for nerghbor-joining method

It's easy to use
Go to Makefile directory

    make 

Then

    ./TreeDM [options]

	
You can get patterns file and Distance_Matrix(DM.txt) file

Use this DM.txt as input for nerghbor-joining method
You can get a phylogenetic tree


If you have the phylip package installed. Generate a phylogenetic
tree using ./neighbor DM.txt in the folder where the 
executable program is located.
