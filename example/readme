A low similarity protein sequences containing 200 sequences

Runï¼š 

	[path]/TreeDM -n 3 -s 0.03 -m 2 -i seqfile.fasta

	non-wildcard is 3; support is 0.03; max-wildcard is 2
	(change parameters according to the sequences, for high similarity
	sequences: support can't be too small, the non-wildcard and max-wildcard
	can't be too big. For DNA sequences, you can set max-wildcard is 0, and set 
	non-wildcard big.)
	
You can get a ppfile(all patterns for construct pattern vectors) and a
DM.txt(distance matrix for neighbor-joining method) file.

Use neighbor-joining method(neighbor) from PHYLIP package you can download at 
	http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/getme-new1.html
and install according to 
	http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/install.html

Run neighbor use:

	[path]/neighbor DM.txt(infile)

Output of neighbor are outfile and outtree

You can specifies the output_file path using -p and -o  
	
	[path]/TreeDM -n 3 -s 0.03 -m 2 -i seqfile.fasta -p [path]/patterns_file -o [path_for_DistanceMatrix] 
	[path]/neighbor DM.txt(infile)
