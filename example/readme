A low similarity sequences containing 200 sequences

Runï¼š 

	[path]/TreeDM -n 3 -s 0.03 -m 2 -i seqfile.fasta

You can get a ppfile(all patterns for construct pattern vectors) and a
DM.txt(distance matrix for neighbor-joining method) file.

Use neighbor-joining method(neighbor) from PHYLIP package you can download at 
	http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/getme-new1.html
and install according to 
	http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/install.html

Run neighbor use:

	[path]/neighbor DM.txt(infile)

Output of neighbor are outfile and outtree

You can specifies the output_file path using -p and -o  
	
	[path]/TreeDM -n 3 -s 0.03 -m 2 -i seqfile.fasta -p [path]/patterns_file -o [path_for_DistanceMatrix] 
	[path]/neighbor DM.txt(infile)
